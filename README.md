#Swiss.js

###Swiss army knife of 'odds and ends' utilities in JavaScript
####i.e. things that should be there but aren't

Swiss.js is aimed at adding microhelper utilities in JavaScript that really ought to be there.

Using each one is completely optional.  Note that some of these will modify Object or Array prototypes, so if you have objection to this practice simply do not use those helpers.  For the more adventurous among you, you may find these modifications useful.
