#Swiss.js

###Swiss army knife of 'odds and ends' utilities in JavaScript
#####i.e. things that jQuery and Underscore missed

Swiss.js is aimed at adding microhelper utilities in JavaScript that really ought to be there.

It works in <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> and the browser.

Using each function is completely optional.  Note that some of these will modify Object or Array prototypes, so if you have objection to this practice simply do not use those helpers.  For the more adventurous among you, you may find these modifications useful.

Rationale: Almost every project, in every company, has a Javascript 'Util' object, and they almost always do the same kinds of things.  Swiss aims to capture some of those common patterns, however tiny they may be.
